# Shell Seasonality Research: A Comprehensive Review and Data Repository

Welcome to the Shell Seasonality Research Repository, an open-access platform dedicated to advancing our understanding of mollusc seasonality studies within archaeological contexts. This repository is based on the review presented in "A Current Assessment and Commentary on the Field of Shell Seasonality" by Niklas Hausmann, focusing on the outcomes, methods, and ideas spanning over 50 years of shellfish seasonality studies.

## About the Study

The review summarises findings from over 70 studies and +400 sites, providing insights into the seasonality, spatial and temporal distribution, species of interest, sample sizes, and methods determining season. Key highlights include case studies that spotlight significant aspects of seasonality research, aiming to reintegrate valuable ideas into current studies.

## Data Description

This repository contains curated data from publications up to 2020, focusing on mollusc remains used to determine the season of capture. It encompasses:

- General location and method of analysis
- Analysed species, distinguishing between marine and freshwater
- Information on site types, environmental settings, and questions asked of the shells
- General results of seasons indicated, highlighting the diversity and specificity of local environments
- Statistics on the use of isotope samples, edge samples, numbers of specimen etc.

## Contribution and Use

Researchers and enthusiasts are encouraged to use this repository for their own questions, contribute new data, and build upon the existing dataset. The aim is to foster a collaborative environment that supports the growth and depth of seasonality research.

## Getting Involved

To contribute or use the data:

- **Explore the Data**: Review the existing datasets and findings to understand the scope and depth of the research.
- **Contribute New Data**: If you have conducted relevant studies or have access to unpublished data, consider contributing to enrich the repository.
- **Build Upon the Research**: Use the data for your own research questions, and share your findings to create a feedback loop that benefits the entire community.
